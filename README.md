# Classification Model Using PySpark

This code predicts whether the plane is **delayed** or **not** using **Logistic Regression**, a **Classification Method** in **Machine Learning**. I used PySpark in order to use **Logistic Regression** library for this code.

The final result of the accuracy is **81.47%**
